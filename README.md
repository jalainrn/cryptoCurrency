This is a small project created for my CodeLouisville CSHARP course.

This only pull data from the CoinMarketCap's API (https://api.coinmarketcap.com)



## Set up the project
Clone the project
```

git clone https://github.com/jalainrn/cryptoCurrency.git
```

## What it does

1- Check if file data.txt exists in the project directory
	If so, loads the data form the file.
	If not, downloads the data from the CoinMarketCap's API and creates the data.txt file.
2- Display the menu with three options.
